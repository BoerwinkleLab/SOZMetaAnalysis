[The stat concepts and the mindset when looking at the two model types]
[This text can go into the INTRO or METHODS/Stat Methods or even an appendix]



In the fixed-effecs model, each of the 24 studies comes from an
underlying population of subjects.
Thus there are 24 populations, and statistical inferences are only about 
them. There is no population of studies. Any differences between studies 
are systematic differences, not random variation. The patients within a study
are all independent of each other, and also independent of patients in the other studies.
For analyses that rely on large-sample theory, the sample size in each study (2x2 table) must 
be 20 or more and there should be no margin with 0 count. Among the methods used here, 
only the "exact" CI's for odds ratios do not require large samples. But small tables will generate
very wide and nearly useless CI's.


In the random-effecs model, the 24 studies come from an
underlying population of studies. The main target of inference 
is that population, primalrily the variation among studies. 
Differences between populations are due to random variation.
The patients within a study are all correlated with each other but 
independent of patients in the other studies.



Confusingly, the word "heterogeniety" is used in both models. 
In the fixed-effects model, "heterogeniety" refers to the non-random
systematic differences among studies (or populations).
However, in the random-effects model, the same word refers to the random
variation among the studies (or populations). This difference impacts
the interpretation of hypothesis tests in these models.

[RESULTS]


The odds ratio is a common measure in epidemiology, often used 
as an index of association between risk factors and disease outcomes.
The odds ratio is used here to measure concordance or agreement
between two modalities. The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds that modality A
is positive when modality B is positive to the odds that modality A
is positive when modality B is negative. An odds ratio of 1 means that 
the modalities are independent; they neither agree nor
disagree more than expected by just random chance.
An odds ratio greater (less) than 1 means that
the modalities tend to agree (disagree) more than 
expected by just random chance.



In the fixed-effects model, the hypothesis of homogeniety of
the odds ratios states that the 24 odds ratios in the 24 studies are all equal.
Testing this hypothesis requires an adequate sample size in each study. Thus,
this analysis was restricted to studies with sample size of at least 20,
and with no zero margins. This left 7 studies (n from 29 to 64, total n 298). 
Using the likelihood ratio test in a log-linear model,
the hypothesis of homogeniety was
rejected in favor of heterogeniety (chi-squared=27.61, df=6, p= 0.00011).
The conclusion is that there is significant heterogeniety of the odds ratios 
among those 7 studies. Under the assumption of homogeniety, the
estimate of the common odds ratio was 8.0 (95% CI: 4.3 to 15). However,
the usefulness of this single estimate is highly questionable because there is
strong evidence against the existence of a common odds ratio.

Figure 2: Fixed Effects Analysis
Each study was summarized into a 2x2 table and
conditional likelihood-based estimates were obtained if there are no zero cells.
In five studies, one cell was zero and median unbiased estimates were obtained. 
If any margin is zero, the study is non-informative. This left the 10 studies
shown in this figure. 
As there is very strong evidence against the existence of a common odds ratio,
no overall estimate is presented as its usefulness is highly questionable.

The last line should be removed.


[RESULTS related to  Figure 3]

The random-effects model includes a random study-specific log odds ratio measuring
the concordance between fsMRI and the comparaive.
Predicted study-specific log odds ratios, posterior mode and prediction intervals are depicted.
The study-specific log odds ratios, assumed normally distributed,
are estimated to have a mean (and median) of 0.007 and
a standard deviation of 3. This implies that
the estimated median odds ratio is 1.007, while 
the estimated mean odds ratio is 90.
This difference between the mean and median is due to the right-skewness of
the log-normal distribution of the odds ratios.



[Stat METHODS]

In the fixed-effects analysis, conditional likelihood-based estimates were
obtained if all four cells are non-zero.
In five studies, one cell was zero and median unbiased estimates were obtained. 
If any margin is zero, the study is non-informative. This left 10 studies
for odds ratio estimation under the fixed-effects model.

Analysis of "modality"
======================
(this text was added on Sep 7, 2023)

Modality is coded 0 to 4, with frequencies 4, 8, 2, 5, 6, respectively.
The fixed-effects analysis given above was restricted to the 7 studies with n>=20 and no zero margins.
Here we continue with the same structure and the same set of 7 studies with 298 patients.
The modalities for those 7 studies were 0,1,1,3,3,4,4.
A sequence of log-linear models for the odds ratios was fitted. 
The analysis of deviance table is:

Model		df	dev
1		6	27.61
1+modality	3	14.60
1+study		0	0 [the saturated model]	
Interpretation:
Among 7 studies there are 6 contrasts (differences) between studies.
Among 4 modalities there are 3 contrasts between modalities.
The total deviance of 27.61 reflects the differences among the 7 studies.
Those differences can be decomposed into differences between modalities
(27.61-14.60=13.01, df=3, p=0.0046) and differences between studies
using the same modality (14.60, df=3, p=0.0022). That is, there are statistically 
significant differences among modalities and also among studies with the same modality.
